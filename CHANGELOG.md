Casual reminder: if you get any questions or issues while using FO, our Discord (https://fabulously-optimized.github.io/discord) is the first place to ask in. Asking in other generic or mod-specific servers may not give you the same support, as they don't know how FO is configured.

(the name is arbitrary and not reflected in-game)

### 4.3.1 (2022-09-11)

A small reminder, somewhat related to the Iris bugfix:

If you see that your resourcepack says "contains broken paths" as you try to activate it, please tell the resource pack maker to only use the following characters in file/folder names: `a-z0-9/._-`. 
That way everyone will have resource packs that work better and have less bugs!

- Removed Don't Clear Chat History - had several issues, including unintended features on 1.19

- Removed Hold That Chunk as it was not deemed ready yet
- Updated Debugify, Fabric Language Kotlin, No Chat Reports, Zoomify
- Updated Russian in MMH by RozeFound

Modrinth-only:

### 4.2.0-beta.6 (2022-08-23)

- Updated Hold That Chunk
  - Hold That Chunk fixed the config so now, again, it has Farsight parity. It was partly my fault too :D
- Zoomify update temporarily skipped due to a bug
- Updated Greek in MMH by RaptaG

### 4.2.0-beta.5 (2022-08-22)

  - Only applies for new profiles, for existing ones just set VSync to Adaptive in video settings (if you can)
- Removed Cull Less Leaves crash workaround

### 4.2.0-beta.3 (2022-08-15)

FO 4.2.0 is still estimated to be released in August, we have just a few more things to test...

- Added MixinTrace - helps developers find the cause of crashes
- Added Cloth Config API - technically it has always been there inside some mod, but currently a specific version of it is required
- Removed Not Enough Crashes - turned out to be not that helpful for developers
- Removed MoreCulling - performance testing results were inconclusive, some mods had incompatibilities. Decided not to add it for 4.2.0 yet, but keeping an eye on it for the future.

.

- Updated Entity Texture Features, Language Reload, Reese's Sodium Options
- Updated Korean in MMH by AlphaKR93

### 4.2.0-beta.2 (2022-08-12)

  - Modrinth users: if this mod runs well, FO will have 100% mod parity on Modrinth :)
- Removed Farsight - now redundant
- Updated Continuity, MoreCulling, No Chat Reports, Not Enough Crashes, Reese's Sodium Options

- No Chat Reports: disabled full-screen warnings to avoid warning fatigue, the status is still shown in chat's bottom right corner
  - Feel free to re-enable the warning from config (disable "whitelistAllServers")
  - When updating to this version, this change will apply for everyone
- Updated Turkish and Portuguese (Brazil) in MMH by Localfossa and PaperKing13isPro
