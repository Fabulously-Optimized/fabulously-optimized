# Code of conduct
## DO

* Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates
* Report bugs regarding the modpack
* Suggest mods and changes for the modpack
* Discuss issues that are already open, [especially if they are labeled "feedback/testers wanted"](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feedback%2Ftesters+wanted%22)
* Pull request changes that improve the reliability of [CLI scripts](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/tree/main/CLI%20tools)

## DO NOT 

* Use issues for generic questions, do that in Discord instead
* Report issues or questions regarding hacked clients or piracy
* Pull request any modpack structure changes directly (e.g. adding new mods), discuss those in an issue instead
* Pull request localization changes, [follow these instructions instead](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/language-support) 
* Disrespect anyone
