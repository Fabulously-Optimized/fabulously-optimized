# Code of Conduct #

## DO ##

- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates
- Report bugs regarding the modpack
- Suggest mods and changes for the modpack
- Discuss issues that are already open, [especially if they are labeled "feedback/testers wanted"](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feedback%2Ftesters+wanted%22)
- Pull request changes that improve the reliability of [CLI scripts](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/tree/main/CLI%20tools)

## DO NOT ##

- Use issues for generic questions, do that in Discord instead
- Report issues or questions regarding hacked clients or piracy
- Pull request any modpack structure changes directly (e.g. adding new mods), discuss those in an issue instead
- Pull request localization changes, [follow these instructions instead](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/language-support)
- Disrespect anyone
