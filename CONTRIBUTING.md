So you like this modpack and want to support it? That's great! In this page I have listed the ways you can contribute.

### Support

* **[⬇️ Download the pack from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/)**
  * More specifically, using either
     * [CurseForge Launcher](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#curseforge-launcher)
     * [MultiMC](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#multimc)
     * [vanilla launcher](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#minecraft-launcher-the-vanilla)
  * give the pack and mod devs money, other launchers currently do not.
* **[❤️ Heart and comment on AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/fabulously-optimized/about/)**

  * [...and then maybe browse my content a bit to give me ad money?](https://modrinth.com/user/robotkoer)
