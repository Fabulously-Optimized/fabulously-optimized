So you like this modpack and want to support it? That's great! In this page I have listed the ways you can contribute.

### Support us

* **▶️ Play using [CurseForge App](https://download.fo/curseforge) or [Modrinth App](https://download.fo/modrinth)**
  * Using one of these launchers gives the pack and mod devs money, other launchers currently do not.
* **[❤️ Heart and comment on AlternativeTo](https://download.fo/rate)**
  * Please sign up before doing it, otherwise it will not count ☹️
* **[🦸 Get a free FO cape](https://wiki.download.fo/readme/free-cape)** 
* **[🛑 Disable ad blocker on Modrinth](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/details/ads/#browser-extensions)**
  * [...and then maybe browse my content a bit to give me ad money?](https://modrinth.com/user/robotkoer)
  * I do _not_ recommend disabling it on CurseForge due to the intrusive ads there.
