So you like this modpack and want to support it? That's great! In this page I have listed the ways you can contribute.

* **[Download the pack from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/files)** - seriously, that is the easiest thing that helps the modpack and its mods the most. Every download contributes to the [CurseForge rewards system](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197898-rewards-program-terms-of-service#1.-Description-of-Rewards-Program), meaning both the modpack dev and the modders can get monetary rewards.
  * More specifically, using 
     * [CurseForge Launcher](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#curseforge-launcher)
     * [MultiMC](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#multimc) (when downloaded via the CurseForge listing) 
     * [Vanilla Launcher](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#minecraft-launcher-the-vanilla)
  * support the pack, other launchers/methods unfortunately do not.
* **Donate to the mods**, for example:
  * [JellySquid](https://jellysquid.me/donate), the creator of Sodium/Lithium/Phosphor/Hydrogen
  * [coderbot](https://www.patreon.com/coderbot), the main developer of Iris Shaders 
  * [2No2Name](https://www.patreon.com/2No2Name), the main developer of Lithium
  * [FlashyReese](https://ko-fi.com/flashyreese), the developer of Sodium Extra 
  * [traben_0](https://ko-fi.com/traben), the developer of Entity Texture Features
  * For other mods, [see their respective pages](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/INCLUDED-MODS.md).
* **Contribute to mods** - simple things like suggesting features, reporting bugs when you encounter an issue and [translating your language](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/language-support#translating-mods) really do help out the mods. [You can translate Fabulously Optimized's Mod Menu Helper as well!](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/language-support#translating-mod-menu-helper)
* **Contribute to FO wiki** - just make a PR here: https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/wiki
* **Give feedback to the pack** - giving your ideas on what to add or change about the pack makes sure that we all can get the best quality out of it. Mod suggestions and bugs [can be posted to issues here](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/issues) and general questions are expected on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB).
* **Create a Minecraft server** - [my BisectHosting affiliate link](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/aff.php?aff=2604) will give you 25% off for the first month. Having more users there can give the modpack dev some monetary benefits similar to CF rewards.
* **Contribute to FO toolkit** - If you know Java, you can help with [Packwiz vanilla installer](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-vanilla-installer); if you know Python, you can improve [my CLI scripts](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/tree/main/CLI%20tools).
* **Make a mod for FO** - currently I am looking for:
  * [OptiFine's custom sky/clouds support](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/72)
  * [Any OptiFine parity that's not there yet](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/give-up-optifine)
* **Share the modpack** - more people = more downloads :)
