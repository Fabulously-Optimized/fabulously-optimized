### Performance

Fabulously Optimized is usually faster than OptiFine thanks to [modern performance mods][1] such as Sodium, Lithium and more!

### OptiFine parity

Fabulously Optimized [supports almost all OptiFine features][2], including shaders, connected textures and zoom. [You can even get your own free cape!][3]

### Minor tweaks

Fabulously Optimized [includes a few minor tweaks][4] that don't break the vanilla feel, such as extended chat history, windowed fullscreen mode, fixes to most common bugs and utilities to diagnose crashes.

### Works everywhere

Fabulously Optimized has no content mods, so it works on any world or server. The modpack [can be run on 5 launchers, is hosted on 3 sites][6] and [is translated to many languages][7].

### Up to date

Fabulously Optimized [receives fast updates][5] and is one of the first modpacks to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions.

### Built on Fabric

Compared to Forge, Fabric is lightweight, updates and loads fast, and still has great mod support.

### Open development

Fabulously Optimized [is open-source][8] and so are most of its mods. We welcome suggestions from the users and collaborate with mod developers to create a better user experience for everyone.
