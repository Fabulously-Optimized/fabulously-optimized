Fabulously Optimized

A Fabric-based modpack for Minecraft that focuses on performance and graphics optimizations. 

(Video thumbnail)

### Performance

Fabulously Optimized is usually faster than OptiFine due to the inclusion of [modern performance mods][1] like Sodium and Lithium.

### OptiFine parity

Fabulously Optimized [supports almost all OptiFine features][2], including shaders, connected textures, better grass and zoom.

### Minor tweaks

Fabulously Optimized [includes minor tweaks][3] that don't break the vanilla feel, such as increased chat history, windowed full screen mode and bugfixes to most common issues.

### Up to date

Fabulously Optimized receives fast updates and is one of the first modpacks to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions.

### Works everywhere

Fabulously Optimized is designed to work on any world or server, [runs on 4 launchers, is hosted on 3 sites][4] and [and supports many languages][5].

### Open development

Fabulously Optimized [is open-source][6] (and so are most of its mods), developed with the ideas from the community and by collaborating with mod developers.

### Built on Fabric

Compared to Forge, Fabric updates and loads fast, does not include huge libraries and still has great mod support. [(Yes, Quilt is being considered.)][7]

## Disclaimers

* The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own. 
    * The command /ghost (provided by [AntiGhost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost)) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers [as it sends a slight amount of packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost?comment=103), but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only when you are stuck in blocks.
* This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following: 
    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone. 

    * You must also be aware that you can use [the "social interactions" screen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) by pressing the key `P` in-game.
* This modpack is using [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) for chunk optimization and [due to the way it works](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#chunk-save-format), disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
