# Packwiz

[Packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz) is a tool for making self-updating modpacks for MultiMC.

The best way to update it for Fabulously Optimized is to just create a CF pack and update the Packwiz manifests (`index.toml` and the hash of `pack.toml`) via the [Python tool](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CLI%20tools/CurseForge%20to%20Packwiz-Modrinth.py).

After that it is possible to just use the MultiMC pack created in MultiMC-Packwiz, instructions are in the Packwiz repo. Because Packwiz cannot upgrade the MC itself, the modpack versions are foldered by Minecraft versions (always latest for the version).

Requirements:

1. [Download the manifest creating executable from here](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz/actions) and place it to `../Packwiz`.
2. [Download the MultiMC bootstrap from here](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases) and place it to `../MultiMC-Packwiz/Fabulously Optimized (auto-update)/.minecraft`

The `.sh` scripts are for the users that want to disable some mods from FO. [See the tutorial for more info.](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/multimc-auto-update#can-i-ignore-some-of-the-mods)
