# Fabulously Optimized

A simple modpack for people who are used to having Forge and OptiFine and are curious to see what equivalents Fabric has to offer. You could consider this modpack a "starting point" to optimize your game before adding more functional mods or you could just play this as if it was vanilla - the choice is yours. 

The pack only adds performance and graphics enhancements to the client, so **it works on every world and server**.

The selected mods are inspired, but not limited by the [list of Optifine alternatives](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754). Starting with 2.0, the modpack also [improves the default settings](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/wiki/Changed-options).
