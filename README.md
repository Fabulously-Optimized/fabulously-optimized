# Fabulously Optimized

A simple modpack for people who are used to having Forge and OptiFine and are curious to see what equivalents Fabric has to offer. You could consider this modpack a "starting point" to optimize your game before adding more functional mods or you could just play this as if it was vanilla - the choice is yours. 

The pack only adds performance and graphics enhancements to the client, so **it works on every world and server**.
