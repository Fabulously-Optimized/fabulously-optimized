## Disclaimers

By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

* The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own.
  * The modpack supports controllers, whose usage may trigger anticheats on some servers due to unexpectedly smooth movement. Check server rules before using. 
* This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.wiki/w/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following: 
    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone. 
    *  [The "social interactions" screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) can be used by pressing the key `P` in-game or the `Player Reporting` button in the pause menu.
    * On servers where chat signing is optional, the modpack opts out of it for the playing user to adhere to server's intent. An indicator icon is added to inform players of the signing status in the server (e.g. for parents who want to know whether a server supports Mojang's chat safety features). [Read more](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/chat-reporting-faq#what-does-this-modpack-do-for-me).
* [Per the privacy and familiarity goals](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/principles), the modpack disables Mojang's analytics collection, individual mod update checkers and donor features, and any other network services that may invade privacy or cause confusion. All of these can be re-enabled by users in respective configs.
* Fabulously Optimized does not host any capes or other cosmetics, nor does it encourage users to buy them from any provider. Instead, the modpack encourages users to [prefer free cosmetics](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/free-cape), while also giving them options to use any paid cosmetics they've previously obtained from certain providers.  
* Yes, you can fork/remix this pack [according to the license](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE.md). You cannot, however, use the "Fabulously Optimized" name or logo to _represent_ your fork (but you can mention that you forked it).
* NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG OR MICROSOFT.
